The Dreamers Project was founded by 
teens to provide technology and training
to students in tech fields. 

For anyone desires to learn tech, 
it is nessacary for the student to have 
a computer. 
Meaning for students interested in the 
tech field, learning tech gets 
complicated. 

The dreamers project not only provides 
computers for
students interested in tech, as well as 
job training in both tech and buisness 
positions.
